# CompileContext

## Purpose

AI agents entering a lifecycle step need relevant spec content and project context to understand the codebase they're working with — assembling this from scattered sources manually would be error-prone and inconsistent. `CompileContext` automates this assembly: it collects context specs according to the project's include/exclude configuration, reads structured metadata via `SpecRepository.metadata()`, evaluates step availability, and combines project context entries, spec content, and available steps into a single structured output. Artifact instructions and step hooks are separate concerns retrieved via `GetArtifactInstruction` and `GetHookInstructions` respectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Ports and constructor

`CompileContext` receives at construction time: `ChangeRepository`, a map of `SpecRepository` instances (one per configured workspace), `SchemaProvider`, `FileReader`, and `ArtifactParserRegistry`.

```typescript
class CompileContext {
  constructor(
    changes: ChangeRepository,
    specs: ReadonlyMap<string, SpecRepository>,
    schemaProvider: SchemaProvider,
    files: FileReader,
    parsers: ArtifactParserRegistry,
  )
}
```

`SchemaProvider` is a lazy, caching port that returns the fully-resolved schema (with plugins and overrides applied). It replaces the previous `SchemaRegistry` + `schemaRef` + `workspaceSchemasPaths` triple. All are injected at kernel composition time, not passed per invocation.

### Requirement: Input

`CompileContext.execute` receives:

- `name` — the change name to compile context for
- `step` — the lifecycle step name being entered (e.g. `'designing'`, `'implementing'`, `'verifying'`, `'archiving'`)
- `config` — the resolved project configuration containing `context`, `contextIncludeSpecs`, `contextExcludeSpecs`, per-workspace `contextIncludeSpecs` / `contextExcludeSpecs`, and `contextMode`
- `followDeps` (optional, default `false`) — when `true`, performs the `dependsOn` transitive traversal (step 5 of context spec collection) to discover additional specs. When `false` or absent, traversal is skipped and only specs collected in steps 1–4 are included.
- `depth` (optional) — only valid when `followDeps` is `true`; limits `dependsOn` traversal to N levels deep (1 = direct dependencies only, 2 = deps of deps, etc.). When absent and `followDeps` is `true`, traversal is unlimited.
- `sections` (optional) — when present, restricts the metadata content rendered for each spec in the output to the listed sections (`'rules'`, `'constraints'`, `'scenarios'`). When absent, all available sections are rendered (description + rules + constraints + scenarios). `sections` applies only to full-mode spec content — it does not affect summary-mode specs, project context entries, or available steps.

### Requirement: Schema name guard

After resolving the schema from config, `CompileContext` must compare `schema.name()` with `change.schemaName`. If they differ, it must throw `SchemaMismatchError`. This must happen before any context collection or instruction assembly.

### Requirement: Workspace resolution for spec IDs

Every spec ID handled by `CompileContext` carries an explicit or implicit workspace qualifier:

- **Explicit qualifier** (e.g. `billing:auth/login`) — the workspace name before `:` is used to look up the corresponding `SpecRepository` in the map.
- **No qualifier** (e.g. `auth/login`) — the workspace is inferred from context:
  - In include/exclude patterns at project level, an unqualified path resolves to `default`.
  - In include/exclude patterns at workspace level, an unqualified path resolves to that workspace.
  - In `dependsOn` entries from metadata, an unqualified path resolves to the same workspace as the spec that declared it.

If a pattern or `dependsOn` entry references a workspace name that has no entry in the `specs` map, `CompileContext` must emit a warning and skip that path. It must not throw.

### Requirement: Context spec collection

`CompileContext` must collect the set of specs to include in the context by applying the five-step resolution defined in [`specs/core/config/spec.md` — Requirement: Context spec selection](../config/spec.md). The steps are:

1. **Project-level include patterns** — always applied, regardless of which workspaces are active.
2. **Project-level exclude patterns** — always applied; removes specs matched by any project-level exclude pattern from the accumulated set.
3. **Workspace-level include patterns** — applied only for workspaces active in the current change (a workspace is active if any of its spec IDs appears in `change.specIds`).
4. **Workspace-level exclude patterns** — applied only for active workspaces; removes further specs from the set.
5. **`dependsOn` traversal** — only performed when `followDeps: true` is passed. Starting from `change.specIds`, `CompileContext` resolves each spec's metadata `dependsOn` entries via `SpecRepository.metadata()`, then follows links transitively until no new specs are discovered or the `depth` limit is reached. Specs added in this step are **not** subject to the exclude rules from steps 2 or 4. When `followDeps` is `false` or absent, this step is skipped entirely. This works in all change states (designing, ready, implementing, etc.) — it is not gated on reaching `ready`.

When a spec in the traversal has no metadata, `CompileContext` emits a `missing-metadata` warning identifying the spec and suggesting metadata generation. Traversal continues with any `dependsOn` information available from the change manifest's `specDependsOn` or from content extraction via the schema's `metadataExtraction` declarations.

A spec matched by multiple include patterns appears exactly once, at the position of the first matching include pattern. Specs added via `dependsOn` traversal that were already included in steps 1–4 also appear once (at their earlier position).

### Requirement: Tier classification

After collecting all context specs (steps 1–5), `CompileContext` MUST classify each spec into one of two tiers based on the `config.contextMode` setting:

**When `contextMode` is `'lazy'`:**

- **Tier 1 (full)** — a spec belongs to tier 1 if it appears in `change.specIds` OR if it appears as a value in any entry of `change.specDependsOn`. These are the specs the agent is actively working on or has explicitly declared as needed context.
- **Tier 2 (summary)** — all other collected specs: those matched by `contextIncludeSpecs` patterns (steps 1–4) and those discovered via `dependsOn` metadata traversal (step 5) that are not already in tier 1.

**When `contextMode` is `'lazy'` (default):**

Tier classification is applied as described above.

**When `contextMode` is `'full'`:**

All specs are classified as tier 1. Behaviour is identical to the pre-change implementation — every spec is rendered with full content.

Tier classification MUST happen after the full collection pipeline (steps 1–5) completes and before rendering. A spec that qualifies for both tiers (e.g. it is in `specIds` AND matched by an include pattern) MUST be classified as tier 1.

### Requirement: dependsOn resolution order

For each spec in Step 5, `dependsOn` is resolved using a three-tier fallback:

1. `change.specDependsOn[specId]` — per-spec dependencies declared in the change manifest (highest priority)
2. Metadata `dependsOn` field — the persisted metadata loaded via `SpecRepository.metadata()`
3. Schema `metadataExtraction` engine — extracts `dependsOn` from spec content when metadata is absent

The first tier that returns a non-empty result is used. If all tiers return empty, the spec is treated as having no dependencies.

### Requirement: Cycle detection during dependsOn traversal

During step 5, if `CompileContext` detects a cycle in the `dependsOn` graph (spec A depends on spec B which depends back on spec A), it must break the cycle and emit a warning. It must not enter an infinite loop. All specs that can be reached without traversing the cycle are still included.

### Requirement: Staleness detection and content fallback

For every spec in the collected context set, `CompileContext` must check whether the spec's metadata exists (via `SpecRepository.metadata()`) and whether its `contentHashes` are fresh (all required artifact file hashes match the recorded values).

- **Fresh metadata** — use the structured content from metadata (`rules`, `constraints`, `scenarios`, `description`).
- **Stale or absent metadata** — fall back to the full raw content of the spec's artifact files. Emit a warning identifying the spec path so the caller knows metadata should be regenerated.

Staleness is advisory — it never blocks context compilation. The fallback ensures the context is always assembled, even for specs whose metadata has not yet been generated.

### Requirement: Ports and constructor — PreviewSpec

`CompileContext` MUST receive a `PreviewSpec` instance at construction time, in addition to its existing ports. This is the use case it delegates to for merging deltas into spec content.

```typescript
class CompileContext {
  constructor(
    changes: ChangeRepository,
    specs: ReadonlyMap<string, SpecRepository>,
    schemaProvider: SchemaProvider,
    files: FileReader,
    parsers: ArtifactParserRegistry,
    hasher: ContentHasher,
    previewSpec: PreviewSpec,
  )
}
```

### Requirement: Step availability

`CompileContext` must evaluate whether the requested step is available for the current change. A step is available if all artifact IDs in the matching `workflow` entry's `requires` list (the entry whose `step` field equals the requested step name) have effective status `complete` or `skipped` via `change.effectiveStatus(type)`. A skipped optional artifact satisfies the requirement in the same way a completed artifact does.

If the step is not available (one or more required artifacts are neither `complete` nor `skipped`), `CompileContext` must include the availability status and the list of blocking artifacts in the result. It must not throw — unavailability is surfaced to the caller, not treated as an error.

### Requirement: Structured result assembly

`CompileContext` MUST assemble the result by producing three structured components rather than a single text string:

1. **Project context entries** (`projectContext: ProjectContextEntry[]`) — for each entry in `config.context` (in declaration order): resolve `instruction` values verbatim; resolve `file` values by reading the file at the given path relative to the `specd.yaml` directory. Missing files emit a warning and are skipped. Each entry is an object with:
   - `source` (`'instruction' | 'file'`) — the type of context entry
   - `path` (string, only for `file` entries) — the file path
   - `content` (string) — the rendered text content
2. **Spec entries** (`specs: ContextSpecEntry[]`) — for each spec in the collected context set, produce an entry with: Specs MUST appear in the same order as before: specIds first, then specDependsOn, then include-pattern matches in pattern declaration order, then dependsOn traversal discoveries.
   - `specId` (string) — the fully-qualified spec ID (e.g. `core:core/compile-context`)
   - `title` (string) — the spec title from metadata or extracted from the heading
   - `description` (string) — the spec description from metadata (2–3 sentence summary)
   - `source` (`'specIds' | 'specDependsOn' | 'includePattern' | 'dependsOnTraversal'`) — how this spec was collected. `specIds` for specs in `change.specIds`; `specDependsOn` for specs that appear as values in `change.specDependsOn`; `includePattern` for specs matched by contextIncludeSpecs patterns (steps 1–4); `dependsOnTraversal` for specs discovered via metadata dependsOn traversal (step 5). When a spec qualifies through multiple sources, the highest-priority source wins: `specIds` > `specDependsOn` > `dependsOnTraversal` > `includePattern`.
   - `mode` (`'full' | 'summary'`) — `full` for tier 1 specs, `summary` for tier 2 specs
   - `content` (string, present only when `mode` is `'full'`) — the rendered spec content (rules, constraints, scenarios) using the same fresh-metadata / metadataExtraction-fallback logic as before. When `sections` is present, only the listed sections are rendered.
3. **Available steps** (`availableSteps: AvailableStep[]`) — list all steps declared in the schema's `workflow[]`, each with:
   - `step` (string) — the step name
   - `available` (boolean) — whether the step is currently available
   - `blockingArtifacts` (string\[]) — artifact IDs blocking the step (empty if available)

### Requirement: Result shape

`CompileContext.execute` MUST return a `CompileContextResult` object with:

- `stepAvailable: boolean` — whether the requested step is currently available
- `blockingArtifacts: string[]` — artifact IDs blocking the step (empty if available)
- `projectContext: ProjectContextEntry[]` — rendered project context entries
- `specs: ContextSpecEntry[]` — spec entries with tier classification, source, and content
- `availableSteps: AvailableStep[]` — all workflow steps with availability status
- `warnings: ContextWarning[]` — stale metadata warnings and any other advisory conditions

`CompileContext` MUST NOT throw on availability failures. It MUST throw on `ChangeNotFoundError` (change not found) and on schema resolution errors.

### Requirement: Missing spec IDs emit a warning

If a spec ID from an include pattern or `dependsOn` reference does not exist in the corresponding `SpecRepository`, `CompileContext` must emit a warning identifying the missing spec ID and skip it — no error is thrown. This allows the context to be compiled even when specs are temporarily absent, while making the gap visible.

### Requirement: Unknown workspace qualifiers emit a warning

If a pattern or `dependsOn` entry references a workspace name that has no corresponding `SpecRepository` in the `specs` map (e.g. `billing:auth/*` when `billing` was not wired at bootstrap), `CompileContext` must emit a warning and skip the path. It must not throw.

## Constraints

- Project `context` entries always appear first in `projectContext`, before spec entries
- Missing `file` references in `context` emit a warning and are skipped — no error
- Steps 1–4 (include/exclude patterns) are applied before `dependsOn` traversal (step 5)
- Specs added via `dependsOn` traversal are never removed by exclude rules
- A spec always appears at most once in the `specs` array, classified by its highest-priority source
- `CompileContext` MUST NOT perform direct filesystem reads — all file access goes through `SpecRepository` (for spec files and metadata) or `FileReader` (for `config.context` file entries)
- The caller resolves the config and constructs all `SpecRepository` and `FileReader` instances before calling the constructor
- The `specs` map must contain one entry per workspace declared in `specd.yaml`; workspaces missing from the map produce a warning, not an error
- Artifact instructions, rules, and delta context are NOT part of the result — they are retrieved via `GetArtifactInstruction`
- `instruction:` hook entries are NOT part of the result — they are retrieved via `GetHookInstructions`
- `dependsOn` traversal is opt-in via `followDeps: true`; when absent or `false`, step 5 is skipped entirely
- `depth` is only meaningful when `followDeps: true`; it limits traversal levels (1 = direct deps only)
- `sections` applies only to full-mode spec content rendering; summary-mode specs, project context entries, and available steps are unaffected
- Cycle detection is mandatory — cycles in `dependsOn` must not cause infinite loops
- Fresh metadata (via `SpecRepository.metadata()`) is always preferred; the `metadataExtraction` fallback is only used when metadata is absent or stale
- When `contextMode` is `'lazy'` (default), tier 2 specs MUST have `mode: 'summary'` with no `content` field — only `specId`, `title`, `description`, and `source`
- When `contextMode` is `'full'`, all specs MUST have `mode: 'full'` — behaviour is identical to the pre-change implementation except for the structured result shape
- `PreviewSpec` errors MUST NOT block context compilation — `CompileContext` falls back to base content on any preview failure

## Examples

### Context compilation for any step

```typescript
const result = await compileContext.execute({
  name: 'add-auth-flow',
  step: 'designing',
  config: {
    context: [
      { file: 'specd-bootstrap.md' },
      { instruction: 'Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.' },
    ],
    contextIncludeSpecs: ['default:*'],
    contextExcludeSpecs: [],
    contextMode: 'lazy',
    workspaces: {
      default: { contextIncludeSpecs: ['*'], contextExcludeSpecs: [] },
    },
  },
})
// result.stepAvailable: true (designing has no requires)
// result.projectContext: [{ source: 'file', path: 'specd-bootstrap.md', content: '...' }, ...]
// result.specs: [
//   { specId: 'default:auth/login', title: '...', source: 'specIds', mode: 'full', content: '...' },
//   { specId: 'default:_global/architecture', title: '...', source: 'includePattern', mode: 'summary', description: '...' },
// ]
// result.availableSteps: [{ step: 'designing', available: true, blockingArtifacts: [] }, ...]
```
