# Change

## Purpose

Without a single entity that owns spec work end-to-end, lifecycle state, approval gates, and artifact tracking would scatter across uncoordinated subsystems. A Change is the central domain entity in specd — a discrete, named unit of in-progress spec work covering one or more workspaces that moves from drafting through implementation and into the archive. Every specd operation targets a Change, and the Change enforces its own lifecycle and invariants; no external code may bypass them.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Identity

A Change has a unique, user-defined slug name (e.g. `add-auth-flow`) and a `createdAt` timestamp recorded at creation time. Both are immutable.

Identities in specd are represented by the `ActorIdentity` interface:

- **`name`** — human-readable name of the actor
- **`email`** — unique identifier (often a real email, but may be a hash or masked value)
- **`provider`** — optional identifier of the identity source (e.g. 'git', 'ldap')
- **`providerId`** — optional unique ID within that provider (e.g. LDAP DN)
- **`metadata`** — optional bag of arbitrary string-valued metadata (`Record<string, string>`)

### Requirement: Workspaces and specs

A Change declares:

- **`specIds`** — zero or more spec IDs being created or modified by this change (e.g. `['auth/login', 'billing:invoices']`). An empty list is allowed (e.g. when a change is first created but specs have not yet been assigned).
- **`workspaces`** — a **computed getter** derived at runtime from `specIds` by extracting the workspace component of each spec ID via `parseSpecId()`. It is not a declared or persisted field. When `specIds` is empty, `workspaces` is empty.
- **`specDependsOn`** — an optional map from spec ID to an array of spec IDs representing per-spec declared dependencies. Captured during change authoring to track dependencies independently of `.specd-metadata.yaml`. Used by `CompileContext` as the highest-priority source for `dependsOn` resolution. Not subject to approval invalidation — updating `specDependsOn` does not trigger an `invalidated` event.

`specIds` have their workspace component validated against `specd.yaml` at creation time (the spec path itself is not validated against the filesystem, since a change may create new specs that don't yet exist). `specIds` is **mutable** after creation — specs can be added or removed as the change scope evolves. Any modification to `specIds` triggers approval invalidation (see Requirement: History and event sourcing).

When `specIds` is updated via `updateSpecIds()`, any `specDependsOn` entry whose key is not present in the new set of spec IDs SHALL be removed. This prevents orphaned dependency entries from persisting through save/load round-trips and from causing `CompileContext` to resolve unnecessary transitive dependencies.

`CompileContext` derives the active workspaces from `specIds` via the `workspaces` getter. It resolves `dependsOn` entries directly from `change.specIds` by reading each spec's `.specd-metadata.yaml`, then follows links transitively. This resolution happens dynamically on every execution, not as a snapshot. See [`core:spec-metadata`](../spec-metadata/spec.md) for the `.specd-metadata.yaml` format.

`workspaces` represents the **plural set of workspaces touched** by this change's `specIds` — it is not, and MUST NOT be treated as, a primary or singular workspace identity for the change. A change has no "home" workspace. Consumers building template variables (see [`core:template-variables`](../template-variables/spec.md)) or archive path patterns (see [`core:storage`](../storage/spec.md)) MUST NOT derive a singular value from `workspaces[0]` (or any other index) to stand in for "the change's workspace" — that concept does not exist. `workspaces` remains valid for uses that genuinely need the touched set, such as compile-context resolution and display of which workspaces a change spans.

### Requirement: Lifecycle

A Change progresses through the following states. Two approval gates are configurable in `specd.yaml` (`approvals.spec` and `approvals.signoff`, both default `false`); the dashed paths are only active when the corresponding gate is enabled:

```
drafting → designing → ready ──────────────────────────────────────── → implementing ⇄ verifying → done ──────────────────── → archivable → archiving
                             ╌→ pending-spec-approval → spec-approved ┘                            ╌→ pending-signoff → signed-off ┘
                               (if approvals.spec: true)                                              (if approvals.signoff: true)
```

| State                   | Meaning                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `drafting`              | Initial state; the change has been created but no design work has started                          |
| `designing`             | The agent is elaborating or revising the change artifacts                                          |
| `ready`                 | The design artifact set is complete; awaiting implementation (or spec approval if gate is enabled) |
| `pending-spec-approval` | Waiting for human approval of the spec before implementation may begin                             |
| `spec-approved`         | Spec has been approved; implementation may begin                                                   |
| `implementing`          | Code is being written against the current artifacts and task set                                   |
| `verifying`             | The implementation is being verified against the current verify scenarios                          |
| `done`                  | Verification is complete; the change is ready to archive                                           |
| `pending-signoff`       | Waiting for human sign-off on the completed work before archiving                                  |
| `signed-off`            | Work has been signed off; the change may be archived                                               |
| `archivable`            | Final archival checks have passed; the change may enter archive commit                             |
| `archiving`             | Archive commit in progress — canonical publication and archive move underway                       |

Valid transitions are defined in `VALID_TRANSITIONS`. From `archiving`, the only permitted targets are `archivable` and `designing`.

- `archiving → archivable` MAY occur automatically when an archive commit fails and batch canonical restore completes successfully, or when a pre-commit archive guard fails before commit begins (change never entered `archiving`).
- `archiving → designing` MUST remain available as a manual escape when spec or delta revision is required, or when batch restore itself fails.

Transitions from `archiving` to `implementing`, `verifying`, `done`, or other states are invalid.

The `implementing ↔ verifying` loop may repeat any number of times. The transition `implementing → verifying` is only valid when all tasks in the `tasks` artifact are complete. The transition `verifying → implementing` is valid only for implementation-only failures: the current artifacts still describe the intended behavior and the required fix fits within the already-defined tasks. If verification concludes that the artifacts themselves must be revised, or that new tasks are required before implementation can resume, the change returns to `designing` instead.

Every state except `drafting` MAY return to `designing`. This includes `archiving`. However, when the change is already in `designing` (a `designing → designing` transition), this is a state-preserving re-entry and MUST NOT trigger approval invalidation or artifact downgrade.

Returning to `designing` from a later state (e.g. `implementing → designing`, `ready → designing`, `archiving → designing`) does not imply that artifacts drifted; it means the artifact set must be reviewed again before work can proceed.

### Requirement: Archiving escape transitions

From `archiving`, the only valid lifecycle escape targets are `archivable` and `designing`.

- `archiving → archivable` MAY occur automatically after a failed archive commit when batch canonical restore succeeds.
- `archiving → designing` MUST remain available as a manual recovery path, including when batch restore fails.
- Transitions from `archiving` to any other state MUST throw `InvalidStateTransitionError`.

### Requirement: Implementation and verification loop

The `implementing` and `verifying` states form a loop that repeats until verification passes.

The transition `implementing → verifying` is gated by the workflow model's task completion gating rule (see [`core:workflow-model` — Requirement: Task completion gating](../workflow-model/spec.md)). Because the `verifying` step's `requires` includes `tasks` (which declares `taskCompletionCheck`), the transition is automatically blocked when incomplete task items remain. This is a content-level check on the artifact files, not a check on approval state.

Verification has two distinct outcomes:

- **`implementation-failure`** — the code does not satisfy the current artifacts, but the artifacts still correctly describe the intended behavior and the required fix fits within the existing task set. This outcome returns the change to `implementing` without invalidating or downgrading unchanged artifacts.
- **`artifact-review-required`** — the desired behavior has changed, the current artifacts are no longer sufficient, or the required fix would introduce tasks not already defined. This outcome returns the change to `designing`, where the artifacts are reviewed and updated.

Actual artifact drift is handled separately from verification outcomes. If any validated artifact file changes on disk and enters `drifted-pending-review`, the change is invalidated back to `designing` regardless of the current lifecycle state.

The loop may repeat any number of times. History records each round in full.

### Requirement: Implementation tracking state

A `Change` SHALL persist implementation-tracking state separately from artifact state.

This state MUST distinguish:

- `trackedImplementationFiles` — tracked raw project-relative files under review for the change
- `implementationLinks` — confirmed `spec + file` implementation links, optionally refined by one or more symbols

Each tracked implementation file MUST carry an explicit review state of `open`, `resolved`, `ignored`, or `removed`.

`removed` means the file remains part of the change's tracked review history, but refresh has confirmed that the file is no longer present on disk. A `removed` file is not implicitly untracked and is not manually reopened through `resolve`; it returns to `open` only when refresh confirms the file exists again.

`implementationLinks` MUST support both:

- file-level links (`spec -> file`)
- symbol-level refinements (`spec -> file -> symbols`)

A confirmed link's raw file path remains project-relative while the change is active. Canonical `workspace:path` normalization happens later during archive-time materialization.

### Requirement: Explicit vs container-only file links

The `Change` entity MUST preserve whether a file-level implementation link was explicitly created on its own or exists only as the container for symbol-level links.

This distinction governs link-removal behavior:

- removing the last symbol from a container-only `spec + file` set MAY remove the whole set
- removing the last symbol from a `spec + file` set whose file-level link was explicitly created MUST preserve the file-level link

### Requirement: Historical implementation detection guard

The `Change` entity SHALL expose whether the change has ever entered `implementing` in its history.

Lifecycle use cases use this historical fact to decide when demand-driven implementation autodetection is meaningful. The `Change` entity itself does not perform implementation detection.

### Requirement: Spec approval gate

When `approvals.spec: true`, the transition from `ready` to `implementing` is blocked. The change must first transition to `pending-spec-approval`, receive an explicit approval (approver identity, reason, artifact hashes), and then transition to `spec-approved` before `implementing` becomes reachable.

When `approvals.spec: false` (default), `ready → implementing` is a free transition. The `pending-spec-approval` and `spec-approved` states are unreachable.

### Requirement: Signoff gate

When `approvals.signoff: true`, the transition from `done` to `archivable` is always blocked — regardless of whether the change contains only new specs, modifications, or removals. The change must transition to `pending-signoff`, receive an explicit sign-off (approver identity, reason, artifact hashes), and transition through `signed-off → archivable`.

When `approvals.signoff: false` (default), `done → archivable` is a free transition. Attempting to archive a change that is not in `archivable` state throws `InvalidStateTransitionError`.

### Requirement: Artifacts

A Change holds a set of artifacts — typed files whose types and dependency graph are declared by the active schema. Each artifact is a `ChangeArtifact` that contains zero or more `ArtifactFile` entries — one per file the artifact produces.

A `ChangeArtifact` has:

- **`type`** — the artifact type ID from the schema (e.g. `proposal`, `specs`, `design`, `tasks`)
- **`optional`** — whether the artifact is required for archiving
- **`requires`** — ordered list of artifact type IDs that must be complete before this artifact can satisfy downstream dependencies
- **`state`** — the persisted aggregate state of the artifact
- **`files`** — a `Map<string, ArtifactFile>` of tracked files, keyed by file key

For `scope: change` artifacts there is typically one file keyed by the artifact type id. For `scope: spec` artifacts there is one file per spec ID in `change.specIds`.

Each `ArtifactFile` value object has:

- **`key`** — identifier for this file within the artifact (artifact type id for `scope: change`, spec ID for `scope: spec`)
- **`filename`** — the file path within the change directory
- **`state`** — the persisted file state; this is the source of truth at file level
- **`validatedHash`** — the hash recorded when the file was last validated, computed after applying `preHashCleanup` if declared in the schema. The sentinel value `"__skipped__"` is used when an optional artifact is explicitly marked as not produced.

Allowed `state` values for both artifacts and files are:

- `missing`
- `in-progress`
- `complete`
- `skipped`
- `pending-review`
- `drifted-pending-review`

State semantics are:

- `missing` — the expected file is absent or, for backward-compatible loads, no explicit state was persisted
- `in-progress` — the file exists and is being authored or revised, but has not yet been revalidated
- `complete` — the file has been validated and remains accepted as the current source of truth
- `skipped` — the optional file was explicitly marked as not produced
- `pending-review` — the file was previously validated, but the change returned to `designing` and the file must be reviewed again against the current change intent
- `drifted-pending-review` — the file was previously validated, later changed on disk, and now requires explicit review

`validatedHash` still participates in drift detection and approval signatures, but it is no longer the source of truth for artifact status. A file's current state is read from its persisted `state`, and hash comparison is one of the mechanisms that may change that state.

The aggregated `state` on `ChangeArtifact` is materialized from file states and is also persisted:

- `drifted-pending-review` — at least one file is `drifted-pending-review`
- `pending-review` — no file is `drifted-pending-review`, and at least one file is `pending-review`
- `complete` — all files are `complete` or `skipped`, and at least one file exists
- `skipped` — all files are `skipped`, and at least one file exists
- `missing` — all files are `missing`, or the artifact has no files
- `in-progress` — any remaining mixed or partially-authored state

`skipped` is only valid for `optional: true` artifacts. Attempting to skip a non-optional artifact throws an error.

The `skipped` state must be set explicitly by an actor — human or agent via a CLI command. The agent must be instructed (via the schema `instruction` or skill definition) to call that command when it decides not to produce an optional artifact. The specific CLI command is defined in the CLI spec.

`ChangeArtifact.markComplete(key, hash)` takes two arguments — the file key and the content hash — and delegates to the corresponding `ArtifactFile.markComplete(hash)`. A successful completion sets the file state to `complete`, updates `validatedHash`, and recomputes the parent artifact state. `ChangeArtifact.markSkipped()` marks ALL files in the artifact as `skipped`. These may only be called by the `ValidateArtifacts` and skip use cases respectively. No other code path may set these values.

Returning to `designing` changes review state at file level. Every file in every artifact moves to `pending-review`, except files already marked `drifted-pending-review`, which keep that more specific state. The same downgrade applies when scope changes while the change already remains in `designing`: previously validated files are no longer treated as complete until they are reviewed again.

Dependency satisfaction is driven by the persisted artifact `state`. Only artifacts in `complete` or `skipped` satisfy `requires`. Artifacts in `missing`, `in-progress`, `pending-review`, or `drifted-pending-review` block dependents.

**Rollback:** `invalidate()` accepts affected artifact/file detail for the files whose validated content actually drifted. When drift is reported, those files are set to `drifted-pending-review`, their parent artifacts are recomputed, and all other files are downgraded to `pending-review` as part of the return to `designing`. Upstream files are not marked drifted unless their own validated content changed.

- `pending-parent-artifact-review`
- `pending-parent-artifact-review` — the file's upstream dependency in the artifact DAG is `drifted-pending-review` or `pending-review`, recursively blocking this file until the parent is resolved.
- `pending-parent-artifact-review` — no file is drifted or pending review, and at least one file is `pending-parent-artifact-review`

### Requirement: Artifact sync

A Change can reconcile its artifact map against the current schema's artifact types via the `syncArtifacts(artifactTypes)` method. This method:

1. Compares the current artifact map against the provided `artifactTypes` array.
2. Adds new artifact types and their expected files (based on scope and specIds).
3. Removes artifact types no longer in the schema.
4. For existing artifacts, adds files for new spec IDs and removes files for spec IDs no longer in the change.
5. Returns `true` if any changes were made, `false` if the artifact map was already in sync.
6. When changes are made, appends an `ArtifactsSyncedEvent` to history with the `SYSTEM_ACTOR` identity.

`SYSTEM_ACTOR` is a constant `{ name: 'specd', email: 'system@getspecd.dev', provider: 'system' }` used for automated operations.

### Requirement: History and event sourcing

The change manifest contains an **append-only `history` array** of typed events. Every significant operation appends one or more events. Events are never modified or removed.

The **current lifecycle state** of a Change is derived entirely from its history: the `to` field of the most recent `transitioned` event. If no `transitioned` event exists, the state is `drafting`. No separate state snapshot is stored. The JSON serialization of these events in `manifest.json` is defined in [`core:change-manifest` — Requirement: Manifest structure](../change-manifest/spec.md).

The **current draft/active status** is derived from history: if the most recent `drafted` or `restored` event is of type `drafted`, the change is currently stored under `drafts/` and outside the active working set; otherwise it is active under `changes/`.

The **active approval** for each gate is the most recent `spec-approved` or `signed-off` event that has not been superseded by a subsequent `invalidated` event.

All events share common fields:

- **`type`** — identifies the event kind
- **`at`** — ISO 8601 timestamp
- **`by`** — the `ActorIdentity` of the person or system performing the operation, mandatory on all events

Event types:

| Type                  | Additional fields                                          | When appended                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `created`             | `specIds`, `schemaName`, `schemaVersion`                   | Once, when the change is first created                                       |
| `transitioned`        | `from: ChangeState`, `to: ChangeState`                     | Each lifecycle state transition                                              |
| `spec-approved`       | `reason: string`, `artifactHashes: Record<string, string>` | When the spec approval gate is passed                                        |
| `signed-off`          | `reason: string`, `artifactHashes: Record<string, string>` | When the signoff gate is passed                                              |
| `invalidated`         | `cause`, `message`, `affectedArtifacts`                    | When scope or artifact review invalidates prior approvals                    |
| `drafted`             | `reason?: string`                                          | When a change is moved to `drafts/`                                          |
| `restored`            | _(none beyond common fields)_                              | When a drafted change is moved back to `changes/`                            |
| `artifact-skipped`    | `artifactId: string`, `reason?: string`                    | When an optional artifact is explicitly marked as not produced               |
| `artifacts-synced`    | `typesAdded`, `typesRemoved`, `filesAdded`, `filesRemoved` | When artifact sync reconciles the artifact map against schema                |
| `description-updated` | `description: string`                                      | When the change description is updated via `EditChange` with `--description` |
| `discarded`           | `reason: string`, `supersededBy?: string[]`                | When a change is permanently abandoned                                       |

`invalidated.cause` is explicit and machine-readable:

- `spec-change` — the change scope changed (for example, `specIds` were edited)
- `artifact-drift` — one or more validated artifact files changed on disk
- `artifact-review-required` — the change returned to `designing` because the artifacts must be revised even though no drifted file was detected
- `spec-overlap-conflict` — the change was invalidated because an archived change with overlapping specs was archived with `allowOverlap: true`

`invalidated.message` is a clear human-readable explanation, not a one-word label. `invalidated.affectedArtifacts` is a structured list of the affected artifact types and file keys so callers can explain exactly what triggered the review:

- `type` — artifact type ID
- `files` — list of file keys, using the artifact file key for `scope: change` and the spec ID for `scope: spec`

Approval invalidation caused by artifact drift MUST capture the full set of affected files before the event is appended. If multiple files drift in the same invalidation pass, they are recorded in the same `invalidated` event.

#### Scenario: Overlap conflict invalidation

- **GIVEN** change `beta` targets `core:config`
- **AND** change `alpha` also targets `core:config` and is archived with `allowOverlap: true`
- **WHEN** the archive invalidates `beta`
- **THEN** an `invalidated` event with `cause: 'spec-overlap-conflict'` is appended to `beta`'s history
- **AND** a `transitioned` event rolling back to `designing` is appended
- **AND** the `invalidated.message` includes the archived change name and the overlapping spec IDs

### Requirement: Archive outcome history

A failed archive attempt MUST be traceable through change history without making a failed pre-commit attempt appear as a completed archive.

The `archive-failed` event records that an archive attempt failed while the change was still active. It MUST capture at minimum:

- `step` — the failing phase (`prepare`, `commit`, or `archive`)
- `message` — human-readable failure summary
- `commitStarted` — whether canonical publication or archive move had begun

`archive-failed` captures diagnostics for the failed attempt. It does not by itself advance the external archive lifecycle outcome.

Lifecycle rollback rules:

- Failures before archive commit begins (hooks, preflight, guards while still in `archivable`) MUST leave the change in `archivable`.
- Failures during archive commit (publish or archive move) MUST attempt batch canonical restore first. When restore succeeds, the change MUST transition from `archiving` to `archivable`. When restore fails, the change MUST remain in `archiving` until manual escape to `designing`.
- After a successful archive move, no lifecycle rollback occurs. Metadata generation failures and post-archive hook failures do not undo archive completion.

Successful archive completion is not represented by appending another event to the active change's history after the change has ceased to be an active change. Success traceability belongs to the archived record and archived manifest metadata.

### Requirement: Historical implementation detection

A Change SHALL treat any historical transition to `implementing` as evidence that implementation may already exist, even if the current lifecycle state later returns to `designing`, `verifying`, or another non-terminal state.

This detection is temporary and pragmatic. Until specd can detect whether a change has actually modified code files, the system SHALL derive this signal by scanning the append-only history for any `transitioned` event whose `to` field is `implementing`.

The signal is historical, not state-based. It remains true once reached unless the project later introduces a more precise file-level implementation detector.

### Requirement: Schema version

The `created` event records the `schemaName` and `schemaVersion` of the schema active at creation time.

A **`schemaName` mismatch** (e.g. `schema-std` → `custom-schema`) indicates structural incompatibility. When a use case detects that `schema.name() !== change.schemaName`, it MUST throw `SchemaMismatchError` before performing any work.

A **`schemaVersion` mismatch** within the same schema name is advisory. When a change is loaded and the active schema version differs from the one recorded in the change, the system MUST emit a warning. The change remains fully usable. Archiving with a `schemaVersion` mismatch is allowed.

### Requirement: Drafting and discarding

A change may be moved between storage locations without affecting its lifecycle state. All operations are recorded as events in history.

- **Draft** (`changes/` → `drafts/`) — moves the change to drafted storage. Appends a `drafted` event. If the change has ever reached `implementing`, drafting SHALL fail by default.
  - **`by`** — mandatory `ActorIdentity`
  - **`at`** — timestamp
  - **`reason`** — optional explanation
- **Restore** (`drafts/` → `changes/`) — returns a drafted change to the active working set. Appends a `restored` event. Only `RestoreChange` (via `mutateDraft`) may perform this while the change is drafted.
- **Discard** (`changes/` or `drafts/` → `discarded/`) — permanently abandons the change. Appends a `discarded` event. If the change has ever reached `implementing`, discarding SHALL fail by default.
  - **`reason`** — mandatory human-provided explanation
  - **`by`** — mandatory `ActorIdentity`
  - **`at`** — timestamp
  - **`supersededBy`** — optional list of change names that replace this one

### Requirement: Drafted read-only semantics

When `isDrafted === true`, the change is outside the active working set and MUST be treated as read-only.

While drafted, the change MUST NOT:

- receive lifecycle `transitioned` events
- persist artifact validation outcomes, scope edits, approvals, invalidations, or implementation-tracking updates
- have artifact files written via transforming use cases

While drafted, the only transforming operations permitted are:

- **Restore** — via `RestoreChange` and `ChangeRepository.mutateDraft`
- **Discard** — via `DiscardChange` and `ChangeRepository.mutateDraft`

Read-only inspection MUST use `ChangeRepository.getDraft` or `GetDraft` and MUST return `DraftedChangeView`, not a mutable `Change` exposed to application callers.

Attempts to transform a drafted change through active-change APIs MUST fail with `ChangeNotFoundError` when resolution is active-only, or `DraftedChangeReadOnlyError` when a low-level persistence primitive is invoked incorrectly.

### Requirement: Lifecycle interpretation authority

The `Change` entity is the source of truth for persisted lifecycle facts: history, the current persisted state, artifact files, aggregate artifact states, approvals, and invalidation events.

Dependency-aware lifecycle interpretation is a separate concern. Any decision that depends on the schema DAG, workflow `requires`, recursive parent blocking, approval-gate routing, or step availability SHALL be interpreted by `LifecycleEngine`, not by the `Change` entity itself.

This separation ensures the entity does not need schema knowledge in order to answer questions such as:

- whether an artifact is effectively blocked by an upstream parent
- which lifecycle step is reachable next under the active schema
- whether a requested transition must route through an approval boundary
- which blocker or next action should be surfaced to callers

### Requirement: Policy-aware invalidation

`Change.invalidate()` SHALL accept:

- a domain invalidation cause
- a human-readable message
- a focused `affectedArtifacts` payload identifying the concrete artifact/file entries that triggered invalidation
- an optional `invalidationPolicyOverride`
- a required `artifactDag: ArtifactDag` argument supplying schema-derived DAG structure for policy expansion

The effective invalidation policy is resolved from the override when present, otherwise from the change's persisted `invalidationPolicy`.

Regardless of policy, invalidation SHALL append an `invalidated` history event and return the change to `designing` when the change was previously in another lifecycle state.

Artifact/file-state consequences follow the effective policy:

- `none` — no artifact/file enters a reopened review state solely because of invalidation
- `surgical` — only the normalized affected target set is reopened
- `downstream` — the normalized affected target set and all artifact ids returned by `artifactDag.descendantsOf()` for the normalized target artifact types are reopened
- `global` — every artifact/file in the change is reopened

The entity SHALL deduplicate the final affected set before applying reopened state transitions.

`Change` MUST NOT derive DAG edges from persisted artifact `requires` maps or private BFS helpers; downstream expansion MUST use the supplied `artifactDag`.

### Requirement: Per-file drift tracking

Each tracked artifact file SHALL persist a boolean `hasDrift` signal alongside its canonical workflow state and validated baseline hash.

`hasDrift=true` means the file's current state does not match its validated baseline. This includes changed content and file absence.

`hasDrift=false` means the file's current state matches the validated baseline.

`Change.invalidate()` SHALL materialize `hasDrift=true` only when the invalidation cause is `artifact-drift`, and only for the focused artifact/file entries supplied in `affectedArtifacts`.

Manual invalidation (`artifact-review-required`) SHALL NOT set or clear `hasDrift`.

When a file is canonically `complete` and `hasDrift=true`, human-facing read models MAY render it as `complete-with-drift`.

When a file is canonically `missing`, `missing` remains the canonical state even if `hasDrift=true`.

## Constraints

- name and createdAt are set at creation and never changed
- workspaces is a computed getter derived from specIds via parseSpecId() — it is not a declared or persisted field
- specIds may be empty (empty specIds results in empty workspaces)
- workspaces is the plural set of touched workspaces; it MUST NOT be used to derive a singular "primary workspace" for template variables or archive path patterns
- Current lifecycle state is derived from history (last transitioned event); no state snapshot is stored
- Any modification to the spec list or any artifact content appends an invalidated event followed by a transitioned event back to designing — this may be triggered by use cases or automatically by FsChangeRepository.get() using SYSTEM_ACTOR
- A designing → designing transition MUST NOT trigger approval invalidation or artifact downgrade — re-entering the same step is not a backward transition
- ChangeArtifact contains a files: Map\<string, ArtifactFile> — artifact status is aggregated from per-file statuses
- ArtifactFile status is never inferred from validatedHash alone; canonical file state is determined from explicit state plus current file presence
- validatedHash is the last successfully validated baseline only; it does not prove that the file still exists or is still complete on disk
- hasDrift is persisted per file and reflects whether the current file state matches the validated baseline
- skipped is only valid for optional: true artifacts; attempting to skip a non-optional artifact throws an error
- skipped satisfies the dependency in requires chains and workflow step availability checks — treated as resolved
- On invalidated event, artifact/file reopening is policy-driven rather than always global
- On verifying → implementing: only artifacts in implementing.requires are reset
- ChangeArtifact.markComplete(key, hash) may only be called from ValidateArtifacts
- ChangeArtifact.markSkipped() marks ALL files and may only be called from the skip use case
- syncArtifacts(artifactTypes) reconciles the artifact map against the schema; appends artifacts-synced event with SYSTEM_ACTOR when changes occur
- archivable is the only state from which a change may be archived; attempting to archive from any other state throws InvalidStateTransitionError
- Both approval gates default to false — teams opt in via approvals in specd.yaml
- When approvals.spec: true, spec approval is required before implementing
- When approvals.signoff: true, sign-off is always required before archivable, regardless of change content
- Task completion gating is enforced generically by the workflow model — any step that requires an artifact with taskCompletionCheck is automatically gated (see [core:workflow-model](../workflow-model/spec.md))
- verifying → implementing does not trigger approval invalidation
- History events are never modified or deleted; invalidated approvals are identifiable by a subsequent invalidated event
- Historical implementation detection is derived from append-only history by scanning for any transitioned event whose to field is implementing
- Drafting or discarding after historical implementation requires an explicit force override because implementation may already exist and specs and code could otherwise be left out of sync
- Discarding a change requires a discarded event with mandatory reason and by; it is irreversible
- Schema-aware effective artifact status, recursive blocker resolution, and workflow-step availability are not entity-owned concerns; they are interpreted by LifecycleEngine from persisted change facts plus the active schema
