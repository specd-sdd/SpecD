# Workflow Model

## Purpose

The schema format defines the YAML structure of workflow step entries, but not what those steps mean semantically — when they are available, how they relate to change state, or how hooks and requires are enforced. Without a dedicated semantic model, every consumer (CompileContext, GetStatus, TransitionChange, CLI commands) would interpret step semantics independently, leading to inconsistent gating and unclear agent interaction contracts. This spec defines the semantic model of workflow steps: how step names relate to change states, how requires-based gating works, and how hooks are executed at step boundaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Step names reference domain lifecycle states

The Change entity defines a fixed set of lifecycle states (`drafting`, `designing`, `ready`, `implementing`, `verifying`, `done`, `archivable`, plus approval gate states). The schema's `workflow[]` array references these states via the `step` field — it selects which states participate in the workflow and in what display order, but does not define new states.

If a schema declares a `step` value that does not correspond to a valid Change lifecycle state, `TransitionChange` rejects it with `InvalidStateTransitionError`. The domain enforces the state machine; the schema configures which states are workflow-visible and what gating and hooks apply to them.

### Requirement: Step semantics

Each workflow step has a defined semantic role in the change lifecycle:

- **Designing** (`designing`) — the agent creates or modifies spec artifacts (proposal, specs, verify, design, tasks). This step iterates over the artifact DAG: `CompileContext` is called once per artifact being authored. The step is typically always available (empty `requires`).
- **Implementing** (`implementing`) — the agent writes code and completes tasks. All working artifacts must already be in a review-complete state before implementation proceeds. The step runs once (not per-artifact).
- **Verifying** (`verifying`) — the agent confirms the implementation satisfies verify.md scenarios. Verification has two semantic outcomes:
  - `implementation-failure` — artifacts remain correct and the fix fits within the already-defined tasks; route back to `implementing`
  - `artifact-review-required` — artifacts must be revised, or new tasks are required before implementation can continue; route back to `designing`
- **Archiving** (`archiving`) — deterministic finalization: delta merge, spec sync, metadata generation, archive move. Executed atomically by the `ArchiveChange` use case, not by an agent interactively.

Any file already marked `drifted-pending-review` also forces the workflow back to `designing`; drift is never treated as an implementation-only retry.

### Requirement: Requires-based gating

Each workflow step declares a `requires` array of artifact IDs. `TransitionChange` enforces this at transition time: before allowing a transition to a state that has a workflow step, it checks the persisted artifact `state` for each required artifact ID. If any required artifact has a state other than `complete` or `skipped`, the transition is rejected with `InvalidStateTransitionError`.

An empty or omitted `requires` means the step has no gating — the transition proceeds without artifact checks.

A skipped optional artifact satisfies the requirement identically to a completed one.

Artifacts in `missing`, `in-progress`, `pending-review`, or `drifted-pending-review` do not satisfy `requires`.

### Requirement: Task completion gating

When a workflow step declares a `requiresTaskCompletion` array, the transition system MUST verify that each listed artifact's content contains no incomplete task items before allowing the transition. Only artifacts listed in `requiresTaskCompletion` are content-checked — other artifacts in `requires` are checked only via `effectiveStatus`.

The `requiresTaskCompletion` array MUST be a subset of the step's `requires` array. Each listed artifact ID MUST reference an artifact type that declares `taskCompletionCheck` on its `ArtifactType`. These constraints are validated at schema build time by `buildSchema`.

For each artifact ID in `requiresTaskCompletion`:

1. Look up the `ArtifactType` from the schema to obtain `taskCompletionCheck.incompletePattern`.
2. Get the `ChangeArtifact` via `change.getArtifact(artifactId)`. If it does not exist, skip it.
3. Iterate the artifact's `files` map. For each `ArtifactFile`, load the file content via `ChangeRepository.artifact(change, file.filename)`.
4. If the file does not exist (returns `null`), skip it.
5. Compile `incompletePattern` using `safeRegex` with the `'m'` flag.
6. If the regex is valid and matches any line in the file content, reject the transition with `InvalidStateTransitionError` including a structured reason (`incomplete-tasks`) with the artifact ID and match counts.

When `requiresTaskCompletion` is absent or empty on a workflow step, no task completion gating applies — even if the step requires artifacts that declare `taskCompletionCheck`. The `taskCompletionCheck` on the artifact type defines _what_ pattern to check; the workflow step's `requiresTaskCompletion` controls _when_ it applies.

### Requirement: Step availability evaluation

Step availability MUST be evaluated consistently by all consumers that need it. `CompileContext` evaluates step availability during context assembly. `GetStatus` reports the current change state, which corresponds directly to the active workflow step (since step name = state name). The evaluation is:

```
stepAvailable(step, change) =
  step.requires.every(id => artifact(id).state ∈ { complete, skipped })
```

This evaluation is performed dynamically on each invocation — it is not cached or snapshotted.

### Requirement: Workflow array order is display order

The order of entries in the `workflow` array is the intended display order for tooling (e.g. `CompileContext` lists steps in this order, `GetStatus` shows the current step/state). It does NOT enforce sequential blocking between consecutive steps — each step is independently gated by its own `requires`. A step appearing later in the array may become available before an earlier one if its `requires` are satisfied first.

### Requirement: Step-to-state mapping

Entering a workflow step corresponds to transitioning the Change entity to the lifecycle state with the same name. The `step` value from the schema is used directly as the target state for `TransitionChange`. There is no indirection or mapping table — the step name IS the state name.

### Requirement: Hook execution at step boundaries

All workflow steps can declare `run:` and `instruction:` hooks in their `pre` and `post` phases. When transitioning to a state, `TransitionChange` executes `run:` hooks automatically by default (pre-hooks before the state change, post-hooks after). When `skipHooks` is true, the caller manages hook execution separately via `RunStepHooks`. The archiving step's hooks are executed by `ArchiveChange` via delegation to `RunStepHooks`.

### Requirement: Two execution modes

Workflow steps operate in two distinct execution modes:

1. **Agent-driven mode** — steps like `implementing` require the agent to explicitly invoke `RunStepHooks`. Hooks are not automatically executed by the state transition; the agent must call `specd change run-hooks` to execute them.

2. **Deterministic mode** — steps like `archiving` execute hooks internally. `ArchiveChange` calls `RunStepHooks` directly before performing the archive.

### Requirement: Step requires reference artifact IDs

A workflow step's `requires` array contains **artifact IDs** (e.g. `specs`, `tasks`, `verify`), not other step names. This means step-to-step circular dependencies are structurally impossible — a step cannot depend on another step, only on artifact completion status. The artifact dependency graph itself is validated as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) at schema build time by `buildSchema()`, which performs depth-first cycle detection and throws `SchemaValidationError` if a cycle is found. Since step gating delegates entirely to artifact status, and the artifact graph is guaranteed acyclic, the step availability evaluation is always well-defined and termination is guaranteed.

## Constraints

- Lifecycle states are defined by the Change entity — the schema selects which states are workflow-visible, it does not create new ones
- Step availability is always computed dynamically from `change.effectiveStatus()` — never cached
- `workflow` array order is display order only; it does not create implicit sequential dependencies
- A step with an empty `requires` is always available regardless of change state
- Step `requires` contains artifact IDs, not step names — step-to-step cycles are structurally impossible
- The artifact dependency graph is validated as a DAG by `buildSchema()` — cycles are rejected at schema load time
- The archiving step is the only step that is both a workflow step and handled by a dedicated use case (`ArchiveChange`)
- Task completion gating is controlled by `requiresTaskCompletion` on the workflow step — not by the mere presence of `taskCompletionCheck` on the artifact type
- `requiresTaskCompletion` must be a subset of `requires` and reference artifacts with `taskCompletionCheck` — validated at schema build time
- Task completion checks use `safeRegex` to compile patterns; patterns that fail compilation or contain nested quantifiers are treated as non-matching (no error thrown)
