# ArtifactParser Port

## Purpose

Artifacts come in multiple file formats (markdown, YAML, JSON, plaintext), each with its own parsing, delta, and serialization semantics, so domain services need a uniform interface to operate on any format without importing concrete parsing libraries. `ArtifactParser` and `ArtifactParserRegistry` define this application-layer port — each supported format has a corresponding infrastructure adapter, and the registry collects all adapters keyed by format name.

## Requirements

### Requirement: ArtifactParser interface shape

The port MUST be declared as a TypeScript `interface` named `ArtifactParser`. It SHALL define the following members:

- `fileExtensions: readonly string[]` — the file extensions this adapter handles
- `parse(content: string): ArtifactAST` — parse content into a normalised AST
- `apply(ast: ArtifactAST, delta: readonly DeltaEntry[]): ArtifactAST` — apply delta entries to an AST
- `serialize(ast: ArtifactAST): string` — serialise an AST back to native format
- `renderSubtree(node: ArtifactNode): string` — serialise a single node and its descendants
- `nodeTypes(): readonly NodeTypeDescriptor[]` — describe addressable node types for the format
- `outline(ast: ArtifactAST): readonly OutlineEntry[]` — produce a navigable summary of addressable nodes
- `deltaInstructions(): string` — return format-specific static text for delta generation context
- `parseDelta(content: string): readonly DeltaEntry[]` — parse a YAML delta file into typed entries

### Requirement: ArtifactParserRegistry type

The `ArtifactParserRegistry` type MUST be declared as `ReadonlyMap<string, ArtifactParser>`, keyed by format name. Standard format names are `'markdown'`, `'json'`, `'yaml'`, and `'plaintext'`.

### Requirement: Parse contract

The `parse` method MUST accept a `content: string` parameter and return an `ArtifactAST` containing a single `root` node. The AST MUST be a normalised, format-independent tree structure.

### Requirement: Apply contract — atomic selector resolution

The `apply` method MUST resolve all selectors before applying any operation. If any selector fails to resolve (no match or ambiguous match), the entire application MUST be rejected with a `DeltaApplicationError`. Partial application SHALL NOT occur.

### Requirement: Serialize round-trip

Calling `serialize(parse(content))` MUST produce output that, when parsed again, yields an equivalent AST. Implementations SHOULD preserve formatting where practical, but semantic equivalence is the binding constraint.

For the markdown adapter, serialize/apply behavior MUST preserve inline formatting intent represented in the AST (for example inline code, emphasis, and strong markers) for nodes not targeted by delta operations.

The markdown adapter MUST support serializer style options derived from source content (at minimum unordered list marker, emphasis marker, and strong marker) so merged output can preserve original style where unambiguous.

If source style is ambiguous (mixed markers for the same construct), the markdown adapter MUST serialize deterministically using project markdown conventions so output is stable across runs.

### Requirement: RenderSubtree contract

The `renderSubtree` method MUST accept a single `ArtifactNode` and return the native format string for that node and all its descendants. This is used by `ValidateArtifacts` for `contentMatches` evaluation and by the metadata extraction engine.

### Requirement: NodeTypes contract

The `nodeTypes` method MUST return a static array of `NodeTypeDescriptor` entries describing every addressable node type for the format. Each descriptor MUST include `type`, `identifiedBy`, and `description`.

### Requirement: Outline contract

The `outline` method MUST return a simplified navigable summary of the artifact's addressable nodes, suitable for injection into LLM context during delta generation.

### Requirement: DeltaInstructions contract

The `deltaInstructions` method MUST return a format-specific static text block that is injected verbatim when `delta: true` is active for an artifact.

### Requirement: ParseDelta contract

The `parseDelta` method MUST accept a YAML delta file's raw content and return a typed array of `DeltaEntry` objects. Only the YAML adapter is expected to return a non-empty result; other adapters MAY return an empty array.

### Requirement: ArtifactAST shape

The `ArtifactAST` interface MUST contain a single `root: ArtifactNode` property.

### Requirement: ArtifactNode shape

The `ArtifactNode` interface MUST contain:

- `type: string` — the node type identifier
- `label?: string` — optional label
- `value?: string | number | boolean | null` — optional scalar value
- `children?: readonly ArtifactNode[]` — optional child nodes
- `level?: number` — present on markdown section nodes
- `ordered?: boolean` — present on markdown list nodes
- Arbitrary extra fields via an index signature for adapter-specific metadata

### Requirement: DeltaEntry shape

Each `DeltaEntry` MUST contain:

- `op: 'added' | 'modified' | 'removed'` — the operation type
- `selector?: Selector` — optional node selector
- `position?: DeltaPosition` — optional positioning directive
- `rename?: string` — optional new name for rename operations
- `content?: string` — optional content payload
- `value?: unknown` — optional value payload
- `strategy?: 'replace' | 'append' | 'merge-by'` — optional merge strategy
- `mergeKey?: string` — optional key for `merge-by` strategy

### Requirement: Supporting type shapes

- `NodeTypeDescriptor` MUST contain `type: string`, `identifiedBy: readonly string[]`, and `description: string`.
- `OutlineEntry` MUST contain `type: string`, `label: string`, `depth: number`, and optional `children: readonly OutlineEntry[]`.

## Constraints

- The port lives in `application/ports/` per the hexagonal architecture rule
- No direct dependency on any parsing library (remark, yaml, etc.) at the port level
- Domain services never reference concrete parsers — only this port interface
- `Selector` and `DeltaPosition` are domain value objects imported from `domain/value-objects/`
