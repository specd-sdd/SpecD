# RunStepHooks

## Purpose

Agent-driven workflow steps declare `run:` hooks that need to be executed at step boundaries, but the agent cannot call `HookRunner` directly — it interacts with specd through CLI commands. `RunStepHooks` is the use case that bridges this gap: given a change name, step name, and phase, it resolves the relevant `run:` hooks from the schema and project configuration, executes them via `HookRunner` with the correct failure semantics, and returns per-hook results for the CLI to report.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Ports and constructor

`RunStepHooks` receives at construction time: `ChangeRepository`, `HookRunner`, `SchemaRegistry`, `schemaRef`, `workspaceSchemasPaths`, and `projectWorkflowHooks`.

```typescript
class RunStepHooks {
  constructor(
    changes: ChangeRepository,
    hooks: HookRunner,
    schemas: SchemaRegistry,
    schemaRef: string,
    workspaceSchemasPaths: ReadonlyMap<string, string>,
    projectWorkflowHooks: ProjectWorkflowHooks,
  )
}
```

`HookRunner` uses `TemplateExpander.expandForShell()` internally — `RunStepHooks` does not call the expander directly. It builds the `TemplateVariables` map and passes it to `HookRunner.run()`.

`schemaRef` is the schema reference string from `specd.yaml`. `workspaceSchemasPaths` is the resolved workspace-to-schemas-path map, passed through to `SchemaRegistry.resolve()`. `projectWorkflowHooks` is the full array of project-level workflow step definitions from `specd.yaml` — `RunStepHooks` filters internally for the requested step. If `undefined`, it defaults to `[]`. All are injected at kernel composition time, not passed per invocation.

### Requirement: Input

`RunStepHooks.execute` receives:

- `name` (string, required) — the change name
- `step` (string, required) — the workflow step name (e.g. `implementing`, `verifying`, `archiving`)
- `phase` (`'pre'` | `'post'`, required) — which hook phase to execute
- `only` (string, optional) — when provided, filters to a single hook by its `id`; all other hooks in the phase are skipped

### Requirement: Change lookup

`RunStepHooks` loads the change by name via `ChangeRepository`. If no change exists with the given name, it MUST throw `ChangeNotFoundError`.

### Requirement: Schema name guard

After resolving the schema from config, `RunStepHooks` MUST compare `schema.name()` with `change.schemaName`. If they differ, it MUST throw `SchemaMismatchError`. This MUST happen before any hook resolution or execution.

### Requirement: Step resolution

`RunStepHooks` first validates that `step` is a valid `ChangeState` (a lifecycle state defined by the domain). If it is not, it MUST throw `StepNotValidError`.

If the step is a valid lifecycle state, `RunStepHooks` looks up the workflow step entry via `schema.workflowStep(step)`. If no matching entry exists (the schema does not declare hooks for this state), the use case returns `{ hooks: [], success: true, failedHook: null }` — no error is thrown.

### Requirement: Hook collection

For the matched step and phase, `RunStepHooks` MUST collect `run:` hooks in the following order:

1. Schema-level hooks from `workflow[step].hooks[phase]` — only entries with a `run:` key, in declaration order
2. Project-level hooks from `projectWorkflowHooks` targeting the same step and phase — only entries with a `run:` key, in declaration order

`instruction:` entries MUST be skipped — they are not executable.

### Requirement: Hook filtering with --only

When `only` is provided, `RunStepHooks` MUST filter the collected hook list to the single hook whose `id` matches the value. If no hook matches the ID, it MUST throw `HookNotFoundError` with reason `'not-found'`. If the ID matches an `instruction:` hook instead of a `run:` hook, it MUST throw `HookNotFoundError` with reason `'wrong-type'`.

### Requirement: HookVariables construction

`RunStepHooks` MUST build the contextual `TemplateVariables` from the resolved change and `ChangeRepository.changePath()`:

- `change.name` — the change name
- `change.workspace` — the primary workspace (first entry in `change.workspaces`)
- `change.path` — the absolute path to the change directory (via `ChangeRepository.changePath()`)

Built-in variables (e.g. `project.root`) are already present in the `TemplateExpander` — the use case only builds the contextual `change` namespace.

### Requirement: Pre-phase execution (fail-fast)

When `phase` is `'pre'`, `RunStepHooks` MUST execute hooks sequentially in collection order. If any hook returns a non-zero exit code, execution MUST stop immediately — subsequent hooks are not run. The result includes all hooks that were executed (including the failed one) and identifies the failed hook.

### Requirement: Post-phase execution (fail-soft)

When `phase` is `'post'`, `RunStepHooks` MUST execute all hooks sequentially in collection order regardless of individual failures. Every hook runs even if earlier hooks fail. The result includes all hooks and identifies any that failed.

### Requirement: Result shape

`RunStepHooks.execute` MUST return a result object containing:

- `hooks` — array of per-hook results, each with:
  - `id` (string) — the hook's `id` from the schema or project config
  - `command` (string) — the expanded command string (after template variable substitution)
  - `exitCode` (number) — the process exit code
  - `stdout` (string) — captured stdout
  - `stderr` (string) — captured stderr
  - `success` (boolean) — `true` when exit code is 0
- `success` (boolean) — `true` when all executed hooks succeeded
- `failedHook` (object | null) — if a pre-hook failed (fail-fast), the failed hook result; `null` otherwise

When no hooks match (empty `run:` hook list for the step+phase, or the step has no hooks), the result is `{ hooks: [], success: true, failedHook: null }`.

### Requirement: Works for any step

`RunStepHooks` MUST work for any workflow step, including `archiving`. While `ArchiveChange` handles hooks internally during the archive operation, `RunStepHooks` can also target the archiving step's hooks independently — for example, to run a pre-archive check without performing the full archive, or to retry a failed post-archive hook.

## Constraints

- `RunStepHooks` MUST NOT perform any state transition on the Change entity — it only executes hooks
- `RunStepHooks` MUST NOT execute `instruction:` hooks — only `run:` hooks
- Schema-level hooks always precede project-level hooks within the same phase
- Pre-phase uses fail-fast; post-phase uses fail-soft — this is not configurable
- Contextual `TemplateVariables` are built internally from the resolved change, not passed by the caller
- The use case does not validate whether the step is currently available — the agent is responsible for calling it at the appropriate time
