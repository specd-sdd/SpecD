# SchemaRegistry Port

## Purpose

Schemas can originate from npm packages, workspace directories, or arbitrary filesystem paths, so use cases need a single resolution interface to avoid coupling to any one source. `SchemaRegistry` is the application-layer port that defines the contract for discovering and resolving schemas, allowing implementations to be swapped without changing consumers.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Interface shape

The port MUST be declared as a TypeScript `interface` named `SchemaRegistry` with three methods: `resolve`, `resolveRaw`, and `list`. It SHALL NOT be an abstract class, because there are no invariant constructor arguments shared across all implementations.

### Requirement: Resolve method signature

The `resolve` method MUST accept two parameters:

1. `ref: string` — the schema reference as declared in `specd.yaml`
2. `workspaceSchemasPaths: ReadonlyMap<string, string>` — a map of workspace name to its resolved `schemasPath`

It MUST return `Promise<Schema | null>`. A `null` return indicates the resolved file does not exist; the caller is responsible for converting `null` to `SchemaNotFoundError`.

### Requirement: Resolve prefix routing

The `resolve` method MUST route references by prefix:

- `@scope/name` — npm package; loaded from `node_modules/@scope/name/schema.yaml`
- `#workspace:name` — workspace-qualified; loaded from the `schemasPath` for the given workspace
- `#name` or bare name (no prefix) — equivalent to `#default:name`
- Relative or absolute filesystem path — loaded directly from that path

There SHALL be no implicit multi-level fallback between these resolution strategies.

### Requirement: ResolveRaw method signature

The `resolveRaw` method MUST accept the same two parameters as `resolve`:

1. `ref: string` — the schema reference
2. `workspaceSchemasPaths: ReadonlyMap<string, string>` — workspace-to-schemasPath map

It MUST return `Promise<SchemaRawResult | null>`. `SchemaRawResult` is an object containing:

- `data: SchemaYamlData` — the parsed and Zod-validated intermediate data (before domain construction)
- `templates: ReadonlyMap<string, string>` — loaded template content keyed by relative path
- `resolvedPath: string` — the absolute path of the resolved schema file (used for extends cycle detection)

This method is used by `ResolveSchema` to obtain the intermediate representation needed for the merge pipeline. The existing `resolve` method continues to return the fully-built `Schema` entity for consumers that do not need the merge pipeline.

A `null` return indicates the resolved file does not exist.

### Requirement: List method signature

The `list` method MUST accept one parameter:

1. `workspaceSchemasPaths: ReadonlyMap<string, string>` — a map of workspace name to its resolved `schemasPath`

It MUST return `Promise<SchemaEntry[]>`. The method SHALL NOT load or validate schema file contents — only discover available schemas and return their metadata.

### Requirement: List result ordering

Results from `list` MUST be grouped by source: workspace entries first (in workspace declaration order), npm entries last.

### Requirement: SchemaEntry shape

Each `SchemaEntry` returned by `list` MUST contain:

- `ref: string` — the full reference string that can be passed to `resolve()` (e.g. `"@specd/schema-std"`, `"#spec-driven"`, `"#billing:my-schema"`)
- `name: string` — the schema name suitable for display, without prefix or workspace qualifier
- `source: 'npm' | 'workspace'` — where the schema was discovered
- `workspace?: string` — the workspace name; present only when `source` is `"workspace"`

### Requirement: Schema re-export

The port module MUST re-export the `Schema` type from `domain/value-objects/schema.ts` so that consumers can import both the port and the value object from a single location.

## Constraints

- The port lives in `application/ports/` per the hexagonal architecture rule
- No direct dependency on `node_modules` resolution, filesystem APIs, or any I/O at the port level
- The `Schema` type is defined in the domain layer and only re-exported by this port module

## Spec Dependencies

- [`specs/_global/architecture/spec.md`](../../_global/architecture/spec.md) — hexagonal architecture and port placement rules
- [`specs/core/parse-schema-yaml/spec.md`](../parse-schema-yaml/spec.md) — `SchemaYamlData` type returned by `resolveRaw`
- [`specs/core/resolve-schema/spec.md`](../resolve-schema/spec.md) — consumer of `resolveRaw` for the merge pipeline
