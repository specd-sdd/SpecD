# Documentation Conventions

## Purpose

Scattered or inconsistently structured documentation slows onboarding and makes decisions hard to trace. All project documentation lives under `docs/`, with each subdirectory scoped to a specific concern (ADRs, CLI, MCP, core, schemas). The same constraints apply to both human and agent contributors.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Directory structure

```
docs/
├── adr/        # Architecture Decision Records
├── cli/        # CLI commands reference
├── mcp/        # MCP server tools and resources reference
├── core/       # @specd/core API and domain model documentation
└── schemas/    # Schema authoring guide
```

No documentation lives outside `docs/` except `README.md` at the project root and `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` for agent instructions.

### Requirement: ADR format

Every Architecture Decision Record follows the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) verbatim, with one project-specific addition: a `### Spec` sub-section inside `## More Information` linking to the spec(s) that capture constraints derived from this decision.

```markdown
---
status: '{proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | … | superseded by ADR-0123}'
date: YYYY-MM-DD
decision-makers: list everyone involved in the decision
consulted: list everyone whose opinions are sought; two-way communication
informed: list everyone kept up-to-date; one-way communication
---

# {short title, representative of solved problem and found solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.}

## Decision Drivers

- {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
- {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
- …

## Considered Options

- {title of option 1}
- {title of option 2}
- {title of option 3}
- …

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

### Consequences

- Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
- Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
- …

### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation / compliance of the ADR can/will be confirmed. Is there any automated or manual fitness function? If so, list it and explain how it is applied.}

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {title of option 1}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

- Good, because {argument a}
- Good, because {argument b}
- Neutral, because {argument c}
- Bad, because {argument d}
- …

### {title of other option}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

- Good, because {argument a}
- Good, because {argument b}
- Neutral, because {argument c}
- Bad, because {argument d}
- …

## More Information

{You might want to provide additional evidence/confidence for the decision outcome here and/or document the team agreement on the decision and/or define when/how this decision should be realized and if/when it should be re-visited.}

### Spec

- [`specs/path/to/spec.md`](../../specs/path/to/spec.md)
```

`## Decision Drivers`, `## Considered Options`, `## Pros and Cons of the Options`, and `## More Information` are optional — omit them when they add no value. `### Confirmation` inside `## Decision Outcome` is always present. `### Spec` inside `## More Information` is always present.

### Requirement: ADR numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially starting at `0001`. The filename matches the number and a kebab-case title: `0001-hexagonal-architecture.md`. Numbers are never reused — deprecated or superseded ADRs keep their number and update their status.

### Requirement: ADR creation

An ADR is created for every significant architectural or design decision. Significant means: it affects multiple packages, it constrains future development, or it was a non-obvious choice between real alternatives. Implementation details that follow naturally from prior ADRs do not need their own ADR.

### Requirement: CLI documentation

Every `specd` command has a corresponding doc file in `docs/cli/` describing its purpose, flags, examples, and exit codes.

### Requirement: MCP documentation

Every MCP tool and resource exposed by `@specd/mcp` has a corresponding entry in `docs/mcp/` describing its input schema, output schema, and example usage.

### Requirement: Core documentation

Public types, ports, and use cases in `@specd/core` are documented in `docs/core/` with their purpose, contracts, and usage examples.

### Requirement: JSDoc on all symbols

All functions, methods, classes, type aliases, and interfaces in all packages must have JSDoc comments — not just public exports. This enables IDE tooling, API doc generation, and self-describing code for both agents and human contributors.

JSDoc must include:

- A description of what the symbol does or represents
- `@param` for each parameter with a description
- `@returns` describing the return value (omit for `void` and constructors)
- `@throws` for each error type the function can throw

```typescript
/**
 * Merges a delta spec into a base spec using the schema's delta configuration.
 *
 * @param base - The original spec to merge into
 * @param delta - The spec containing the delta operations
 * @param deltaConfigs - Per-section merge configuration from the schema
 * @param deltaOperations - Optional custom operation keywords (defaults to ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED)
 * @returns A new Spec with all delta operations applied
 * @throws {DeltaConflictError} When conflicting operations are detected in the delta
 */
export function mergeSpecs(
  base: Spec,
  delta: Spec,
  deltaConfigs: readonly DeltaConfig[],
  deltaOperations?: OperationKeywords,
): Spec
```

## Constraints

- All documentation files use Markdown
- ADR filenames must match the pattern `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`
- ADR numbers are sequential and never reused
- Every significant architectural decision must have an ADR
- Every ADR must include a `### Spec` sub-section inside `## More Information` linking to the spec(s) that capture its constraints
- Specs that have associated ADRs include a `## ADRs` section linking to them — omitted if none exist
- No documentation outside `docs/` except `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- A spec's `## ADRs` section lists only the ADRs that _produced_ that spec — they are historical provenance, not dependencies
- A spec may only depend on other specs (`## Spec Dependencies`), never on ADRs directly
- If an ADR's decision needs to be enforced as a constraint, it must first be captured in a spec; that spec is then what other specs depend on

## Spec Dependencies

- [`specs/_global/conventions/spec.md`](../conventions/spec.md) — file naming and Markdown formatting apply to docs too
