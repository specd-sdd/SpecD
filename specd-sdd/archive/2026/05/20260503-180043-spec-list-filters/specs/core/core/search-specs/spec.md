# Search Specs

## Purpose

Consumers need a core-level use case to search spec content by keyword without depending on the code graph. `SearchSpecs` provides content-based search across all configured workspaces by delegating to each workspace's `SpecRepository.search()` method. It is the fallback search path when the code graph is unavailable, and the primary search path for consumers that do not have graph access.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Search across all configured workspaces

`SearchSpecs.execute(query, options?)` SHALL iterate every configured workspace in declaration order and call `SpecRepository.search(query, options)` on each repository. Results from all workspaces MUST be merged into a single flat array sorted by score descending across all workspaces.

### Requirement: Optional workspace filter

When `options.workspaces` is provided as a non-empty array of workspace names, only those workspaces SHALL be searched. Workspace names that do not match any configured workspace SHALL be silently ignored. When `options.workspaces` is omitted or empty, all configured workspaces are searched.

### Requirement: Optional summary resolution

When `options.includeSummary` is `true`, each result MUST include a `summary` field resolved using the same algorithm as `ListSpecs`: metadata `description` first, then `spec.md` extraction fallback.

When `options.includeSummary` is `false` or omitted, `summary` MUST NOT appear on any result.

### Requirement: Result shape

Each entry in the result array MUST include:

- `workspace` — the workspace name
- `path` — the spec's capability path
- `title` — the resolved title (same resolution as `ListSpecs`)
- `score` — the relevance score from the repository search
- `matches` — the array of `SpecSearchMatch` objects from the repository

Optional fields:

- `summary` — present only when `includeSummary` is `true` and a summary is available

### Requirement: Silent error handling

Errors encountered while searching an individual workspace MUST be silently caught. Results from that workspace MUST be omitted from the output, but results from other workspaces MUST still be returned. The use case SHALL NOT propagate I/O errors from individual repository searches to the caller.

### Requirement: Empty results

When no specs match across all searched workspaces, the use case MUST return an empty array (not an error).

## Constraints

- The use case receives a `ReadonlyMap<string, SpecRepository>` — it MUST NOT modify the map or the repositories
- Search quality depends on the adapter implementation; the use case defines the orchestration contract, not the matching algorithm
- Title resolution reuses the same logic as `ListSpecs` — no separate title extraction in this use case

## Spec Dependencies

- [`core:core/spec-repository-port`](../spec-repository-port/spec.md) — `SpecRepository.search()` method and `SpecSearchResult` type
- [`core:core/list-specs`](../list-specs/spec.md) — title and summary resolution algorithm
- [`core:core/workspace`](../workspace/spec.md) — workspace ordering semantics
